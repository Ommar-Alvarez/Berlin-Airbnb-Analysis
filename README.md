# An Analysis of Berlin's Airbnb Industry
This respository contains a personal project done for academic and self-learning purposes. The dataset was sourced from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/brittabettendorf/berlin-airbnb-data">Berlin Airbnb Data</a> Kaggle publishing, and my findings are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks and Jupyter Markdown.

This analysis serves to help hosts set ideal prices for their listings using a supervised machine learning model and identifying key features of Airbnb listings that are determinants of price. This analysis seeks to answer the question “what should Airbnb hosts in Berlin be setting their listing price as in order maximize their available resources.” Moreover, this analysis seeks to identify key resources and amenities would be worthwhile for hosts to include in their listings.
