# An Analysis of Berlin's Airbnb Industry
This repository contains a personal project of mine done for academic and self-learning purposes. The dataset was sourced from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/brittabettendorf/berlin-airbnb-data">Berlin Airbnb Data</a> Kaggle publishing, and my findings are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks and Jupyter Markdown.

The benefactor of this analysis are the Airbnb hosts of Berlin. The purpose of this analysis is to help hosts set ideal prices for their listings using a supervised machine learning model and identifying key features of Airbnb listings that are key determinants of price. By developing a price prediction model, this analysis seeks to answer the question “what should Airbnb hosts in Berlin be setting their listing price as in order maximize their available resources.” Moreover, this analysis seeks to identify key resources and amenities would be worthwhile for hosts to include in their listings.

Accompanying the iPython Notebook is a executive briefing detailing my methodology, findings, and key takeaways.
